How To Keep the Addresses Short</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An algorithm is presented for minimizing the <br>sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced <br>by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of <br>each computer instruction is assumed to be either <br>"long" or "short" ("long," if the memory location addressed <br>is more than a predetermined distance from <br>the current location; "short," otherwise), and (2) <br>there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings <br>(origins) are separated by prespecified amounts </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>For example, <br>some computers permit either 8-bit <b>addressing</b> <br>(interpreted relative to the location counter) or full <br>16-bit <b>addressing</b> of all of memory </p></div></pre></html>
