Memory Management and Response Time</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This paper presents a computationally tractable <br>methodology for including accurately the effects <br>of finite memory size and workload memory requirements <br>in queueing <b>network</b> models of computer <b>systems</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Relations between workload <br>variables such as memory requirement distribution <br>and job swap time, and performance measures such as response <br>time and memory utilization are graphically <br>displayed </p></div></pre></html>
