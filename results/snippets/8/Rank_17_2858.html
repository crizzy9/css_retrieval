A Process for the Determination of
Addresses in Variable Length Addressing</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An algorithm is presented for the assignment <br>of instruction addresses and formats under the <br>following conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies <br>as a function of the distance of the instruction <br>from its target; (2) there exists an optimality criterion <br>which implies some preferential choices subject <br>to the <b>addressing</b> constraints </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This may be, for example, <br>achieving the smallest number of long instructions, <br>in which case the total code length is minimized, or <br>minimizing the assigned address of a specified point <br>in the program </p></div></pre></html>
