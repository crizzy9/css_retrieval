Block Structures, Indirect Addressing, and Garbage Collection</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>However, when indirect <br>addressing is used, as in SNOBOL, naming constraints <br>may be introduced </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Two modifications to SNOBOL are described, <br>resulting in two desirable consequences: <br>(1) naming constraints disappear even when there is <br>indirect <b>addressing</b> within function definitions; <br>and (2) there is a significant saving in the number of <br>calls to the garbage collector, because some garbage <br>is collected, at little expense, each time a function <br>returns to its calling program </p></div></pre></html>
