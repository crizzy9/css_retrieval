High-Level Data Flow Analysis</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This paper proposes a simple general method <br>of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use <br>of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs <br>when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of <br>data flow <b>information</b> to reflect program changes, <br>and derives new global <b>information</b> helpful in solving <br>many familiar global flow analysis problems </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>data flow analysis, high-level language, control <br>flow graph, structured programming, escapes, exits, <br>jumps, goto statements </p></div></pre></html>
