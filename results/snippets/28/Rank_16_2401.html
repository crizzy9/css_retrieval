On Shrinking Binary Picture Patterns</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This procedure <br>may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and <br>a <b>hardware</b> implementation of the algorithm using large <br>scale integrated technology is envisioned </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <br>principal features of this method are the very small <br>window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel <br>nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking <br>any pattern, regardless of the complexity of <br>its configuration </p></div></pre></html>
