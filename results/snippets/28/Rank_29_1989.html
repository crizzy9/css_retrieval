Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The use of augmented transition <b>network</b> grammars for the analysis <br>of natural language sentences is described </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Structure-building <br>actions associated with the arcs of the grammar <b>network</b> allow for the reordering, <br>restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce <br>deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a <br>transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a <br>powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take <br>advantage of semantic <b>information</b> to guide the parsing </p></div></pre></html>
