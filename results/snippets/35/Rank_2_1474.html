Tests of Probabilistic Models for Propagation of Roundoff Errors</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The purpose of this <br>paper is to give precise descriptions of certain <br>probabilistic models for roundoff error, and then to <br>describe a series of experiments for <b>testing</b> the <br>validity of these models </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In any prolonged computation it is generally <br>assumed that the accumulated effect of roundoff <br>errors is in some sense statistical </p></div></pre></html>
