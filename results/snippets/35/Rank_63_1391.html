Computer Experiments in Finite Algebra</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A medium-scale programming system is written <br>in MAD and FAP on the IBM 7094 to manipulate some <br>of the objects of modern algebra: <b>finite</b> groups, maps <br>and sets of maps, subsets and sets of subsets, <br>constant integers and truth-values </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Designed to operate <br>in a time-sharing environment, the system can <br>serve as a teacher's aid to the undergraduate student of <br>modern algebra, as well as for the working scientist <br>or engineer wishing to familiarize himself with the subset </p></div></pre></html>
