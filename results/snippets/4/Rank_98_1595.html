On the Computer Enumeration of Finite Topologies</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An interesting side result of the computational <b>work</b> <br>was the unearthing of a <b>theoretical</b> error which <br>had been induced into the literature; the use of the computer <br>in combinatorics represents, chronologically, <br>an early application, and this side result underscores <br>its continuing usefulness in this area </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <b>problem</b> of enumerating the number of topologies <br>which can be formed from a finite point <br>set is considered both theoretically and computationally </p></div></pre></html>
