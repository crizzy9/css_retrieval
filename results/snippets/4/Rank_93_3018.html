Covering Edges by Cliques with Regard to
Keyword Conflicts and Intersection Graphs</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This optimization <b>problem</b> is here shown to be equivalent <br>to the <b>problem</b> of covering the edges of a graph <br>by <b>complete</b> subgraphs with the objective of minimizing <br>the number of <b>complete</b> subgraphs </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>As consequences of <br>this relationship, the keyword conflict <b>problem</b> and the <br>edge-clique-cover <b>problem</b> are shown to be NP-complete, <br>and if P=/NP then they do not admit polynomial-time approximation <br>algorithms which always produce solutions <br>within a factor less than 2 from the optimum </p></div></pre></html>
