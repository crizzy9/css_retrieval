Exclusive Simulation of Activity in Digital Networks</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The main results obtained <br>are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral <br>model description, a reduction of manual <br>tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model, <br>the elimination of manual processes in achieving <br>exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling <br>technique which does not deteriorate in economy <br>as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation <br>procedure which deals effectively with any mixture <br>of serial and simultaneous activities </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Certain <b>aspects</b> <br>of the techniques described may be used for the simulation <br>of network structures other than digital networks </p></div></pre></html>
