Detection of Three-Dimensional Patterns of Atoms in Chemical Structures</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry <br>are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation <br>of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities; <br>(2) in X-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragment <br>to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of <br>a Fourier map; (3) in chemical documentation; retrieving from <br>a file the structures containing specified substructures </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The search technique <br>presented uses the <b>geometric</b> structure of the pattern to define <br>characteristics demanded of candidates for matching </p></div></pre></html>
