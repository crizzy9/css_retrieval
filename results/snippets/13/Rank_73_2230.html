A Language for Treating Geometric Patterns in a Two-dimensional space</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In this paper CADEP, a problem-oriented language <br>for positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional <br>space, is presented </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Although the language has been <br>specifically designed for the automatic generation <br>of integrated circuit masks, it turns out to be well <br>suited also for such other placement problems as <br>architecture design, urban planning, logical and block <br>diagram representation </p></div></pre></html>
