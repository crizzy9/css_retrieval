Multidimensional Binary Search Trees Used for Associative Searching</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Various utility algorithms are developed; <br>their proven average running times in an <br>n record file are: insertion, O (log n); deletion of <br>the root, O (n^(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, <br>O (log n); and <b>optimization</b> (guarantees logarithmic performance <br>of searches), O (n log n) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This paper develops the multidimensional binary <br>search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality <br>of the search <b>space)</b> as a data structure for storage of <br>information to be retrieved by associative searches </p></div></pre></html>
