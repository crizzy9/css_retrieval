One-Line Random Number Generators and Their Use in Combinations</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The <br>aim is to provide <b>methods</b> for incorporating random number <br>generators directly in FORTRAN programs, by <br>means of a few in-line instructions </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Anyone wishing to experiment <br>with generators, either using congruential <br>generators by themselves or mixing several generators <br>to provide a composite with potentially better <br>statistical properties than the library generators <br>currently available, may wish to consider some of <br>the simple FORTRAN program discussed here </p></div></pre></html>
