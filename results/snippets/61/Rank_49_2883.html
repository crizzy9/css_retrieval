An Application of Heuristic Search Methods to Edge and Contour Detection</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The properties <br>of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge <br>detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing <br>the given figure of merit </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Some experimental results <br>are given; these show how various <b>information</b> about the <br>shape of the contour of an object can be embedded <br>in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction <br>of contours from noisy picture and the separation <br>of touching objects </p></div></pre></html>
