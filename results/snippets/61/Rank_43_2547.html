Representation of Contours ad Regions for Efficient Computer Search</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A novel computer-searchable representation <br>for the three basic pictorial features, contour <br>maps, region coverage, and line structures, is described </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The algebraic properties <br>of the data structure make it computationally easy <br>to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary; <br>compute the area contained by a closed boundary; <br>generate the closed boundary representing the union or <br>intersection of two closed boundaries; and determine <br>the neighboring boundaries to a point and the <br>minimum distances between them and the point </p></div></pre></html>
