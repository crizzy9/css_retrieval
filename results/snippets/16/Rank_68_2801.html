Storage-Efficient Representation of Decimal Data</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Actually, two BCD digits <br>can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits, <br>and three digits into 10 bits, by a very simple <br>algorithm <b>based</b> on the fixed-length combination of two <br>variable field-length encodings </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In over half <br>of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional <br>BCD code by simple removal of redundant <br>0 bits </p></div></pre></html>
