On the Expected Gain From Adjust ing Matched Term Retrieval Systems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A file adjustment procedure <b>based</b> on maximizing <br>the Bayes expected gain proposed for matched <br>term retrieval <b>systems</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The expected gain and its probability <br>distribution are derived as a function <br>of: (1) the prior proportion of omitted terms, and (2) the <br>coefficient of separation between two distributions <br>corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic </p></div></pre></html>
