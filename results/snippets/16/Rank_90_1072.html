An Improved Equivalence Algorithm</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An algorithm for assigning storage on the basis <br>of EQUIVALENCE, DIMENSION and COMMON declarations <br>is presented </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The algorithm is <b>based</b> on a tree structure, <br>and has reduced computation time by 40 percent <br>over a previously published algorithm by identifying all <br>equivalence classes with one scan of the EQUIVALENCE <br>declarations </p></div></pre></html>
