Proving Termination with Multiset Orderings</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The basic approach is to <b>find</b> a termination function that maps <br>the values of the program variables into some well-founded set, <br>such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced <br>throughout the computation </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>All too often, the termination functions required <br>are difficult to <b>find</b> and are of a complexity out <br>of proportion to the program under consideration </p></div></pre></html>
