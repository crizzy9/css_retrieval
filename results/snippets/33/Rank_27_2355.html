Implementing Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, I Methodology and Experience</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is a particularly <br>important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety <br>of reasons, <b>especially</b> the high accuracy obtained from <br>relatively few integrand values </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>However, it <br>has received little use because it requires the computation <br>of a cosine transformation and the arithmetic <br>cost of this has been prohibitive </p></div></pre></html>
