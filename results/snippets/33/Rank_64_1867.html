On the Expected Lengths of Sequences Generated
in Sorting by Replacement Selecting</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In the replacement-selecting technique of sorting, <br>one is <b>interested</b> in the ratio L(j) of the <br>expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the <br>technique to the number of memory cells used </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Using complex-variable theory, it is shown that L(j) <br>-> 2 and that, asymptotically, the average interval <br>between sign changes of L(j)-2 is 2 </p></div></pre></html>
