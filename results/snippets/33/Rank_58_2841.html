Designing Surfaces in 3-D</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The principal features <br>of the system are: <b>(1)</b> the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric <br>line drawings on a head-mounted display, <br>and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional <br>"wand," which allows 3-D movements of the points <br>controlling the shapes of the surfaces, (2) all of the <br>interactions with the surfaces are in real-time, <br>and (3) the mathematical formulations used assume no <br>knowledge of them by the user of the system </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The surfaces are represented in the system <br>as parametric basis splines </p></div></pre></html>
