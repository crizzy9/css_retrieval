Global Optimization by Suppression of Partial Redundancies</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly <br>linear with the size of the program, and that it leads <br>to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The elimination of redundant computations and the moving of <b>invariant</b> <br>computations out of loops are often done separately, with invariants <br>moved outward loop by loop </p></div></pre></html>
