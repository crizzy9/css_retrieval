Optimization of Expressions in Fortran</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The method is based on a <b>linear</b> <br>analysis of the definition points of the variables <br>and the branching and DO loop structure of the program </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The objectives of the processing are <b>(1)</b> to <br>eliminate redundant calculations when references are <br>made to common subexpression values, (2) to remove <br>invariant calculations from DO loops, (3) to efficiently <br>compute subscripts containing DO iteration variables, <br>and <b>(4)</b> to provide efficient index register usage </p></div></pre></html>
