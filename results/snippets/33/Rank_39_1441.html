Methods of Numerical Integration Applied to
a System Having Trivial Function Evaluations</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A study has been made to determine which methods <br>of <b>numerical</b> integration require the least <br>computation time for a given amount of truncation <b>error</b> <br>when applied to a particular system of ordinary <br>differential equations where function evaluations are <br>relatively trivial </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Some of the newer one-step <br>methods due to Butcher are found to be slightly superior, <br>but no one method is found to have any great <br>advantage over the others in the application to this particular problem </p></div></pre></html>
