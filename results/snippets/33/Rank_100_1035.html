Characteristics of the FORTRAN CEP Language</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The FORTRAN CEP languages differs from FORTRAN <br>II mainly because: <b>(1)</b> it extends the variety <br>of the modes for <b>real</b> quantities; (2) it allows suitable <br>mixtures, in an input/output list or in an expression, <br>of quantities that occur under different modes; (3) <br>it makes it possible to address a greater number <br>of input/output equipment; and <b>(4)</b> it removes the restrictions <br>on the complexity of the list of quantities <br>to be transmitted between the magnetic core memory <br>and the drum or the magnetic tape units </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>CACM July, 1964 </p></div></pre></html>
