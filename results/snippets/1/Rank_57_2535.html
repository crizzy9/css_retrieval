The Effects of Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A study is made of the way in which asynchronous <br>time division multiplexing changes the stochastic <br>nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer <br>and, consequently, affects the performance <br>of a time-shared computer-communications <b>system</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It is <br>concluded that while, for certain values of <b>system</b> <br>parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the <br>performance of the computer (model), in the sense <br>that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these <br>improvements are offset by the transmission delays <br>imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or <br>no change in the computer-communications <b>system</b> <br>performance </p></div></pre></html>
