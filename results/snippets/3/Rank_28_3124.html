Recursive Data Structures in APL</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>One of the approaches is used to define an <br>APL array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree structure <br>in which all data is stored at the leaves as homogeneous <br>arrays of numbers and characters </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>An extension of APL is proposed that <br>includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting <br>level of arrays and new operators to assist in the <br>construction of data-driven algorithms </p></div></pre></html>
