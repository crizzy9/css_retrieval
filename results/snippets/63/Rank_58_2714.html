Merging with Parallel Processors</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Consider two linearly ordered sets A, B, |A|=m, <br>|B|=n, m < =n, and p, p < =m, <b>parallel</b> processors <br>working synchronously </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>These performances compare very favorably with <br>the previous best <b>parallel</b> merging algorithm, <br>Batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m <br>steps in the general case and km/p + ((k+1)/2)(m/p)log2 <br>m in the special case where n=km </p></div></pre></html>
