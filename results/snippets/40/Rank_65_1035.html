Characteristics of the FORTRAN CEP Language</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The FORTRAN CEP <b>languages</b> differs from FORTRAN <br>II mainly because: (1) it extends the variety <br>of the modes for real quantities; (2) it allows suitable <br>mixtures, in an input/output <b>list</b> or in an expression, <br>of quantities that occur under different modes; (3) <br>it makes it possible to address a greater number <br>of input/output equipment; and (4) it removes the restrictions <br>on the complexity of the <b>list</b> of quantities <br>to be transmitted between the magnetic core memory <br>and the drum or the magnetic tape units </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>CACM July, 1964 </p></div></pre></html>
