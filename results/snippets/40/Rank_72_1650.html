A Unifying Computational Method for the
Analysis of Complete Factorial Experiments</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A computational method which may be used for <br>the calculation of sums of squares in the analysis <br>of variance of complete factorial experiments and in <br>the computation of main effect or interaction means <br>is described </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The mean expects the <b>data</b> in standard <br>order and it leaves the <b>data</b> in that order <br>so that many analyses of the same <b>data</b> can be performed <br>without rearrangement </p></div></pre></html>
