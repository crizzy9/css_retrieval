Algorithms for Finding a Fundamental Set
of Cycles for an Undirected Linear Graph</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Given the adjacency <b>matrix</b> of the <b>graph,</b> the algorithm <br>presented in this paper finds a spanning <br>tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented <br>by Welch by a ratio of N/3 (N is the number of nodes) <br>but requires less storage </p></div></pre></html>
