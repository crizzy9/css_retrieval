On the Optimal Detection of Curves in Noisy Pictures</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In this technique the <b>heuristic</b> <br>of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm <br>but is expressed in a figure of merit </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <b>method</b> described is suitable for parallel <br>processing because the operations relative to each <br>state can be computed in parallel, and the number <br>of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or <br>to log2 N if the approximate <b>method</b> is used) </p></div></pre></html>
