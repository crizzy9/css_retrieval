On an Algorithm for Nonlinear Minimax Approximation</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterize <br>d by properties which permit the application of special <b>algorithms,</b> <br>mainly <b>based</b> on the exchange <b>algorithms</b> of Remes (1934, 1935), for <br>their solution </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Examples are given to illustrate that this <br>algorithm can give satisfactory results and, in particular, can <br>successfully solve problems which lead to difficulties <br>with the more conventional specialist <b>method</b> </p></div></pre></html>
