Covering Edges by Cliques with Regard to
Keyword Conflicts and Intersection Graphs</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent <br>to the problem of covering the edges of a <b>graph</b> <br>by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing <br>the number of complete subgraphs </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A relationship <br>between this edge-clique-cover problem and the <b>graph</b> <b>coloring</b> <br>problem is established which allows <b>algorithms</b> <br>for either one of these problems to be constructed <br>from algorithm for the other </p></div></pre></html>
