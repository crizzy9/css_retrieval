A Method for Incrementally Compiling
Languages with Nested Statement Structure</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The essential points <br>of the method are: <b>(1)</b> the syntax of the language <br>is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur <br>on lines; (2) an internal data structure (called <br>the skeleton) is maintained to represent the statement <br>structure; (3) the recompilation is partially <br>batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines <br>does not occur until the last of a set of editing <br>commands has been received; and (4) the parsing and <br>compilation are factored into two parts, that done <br>on individual lines and that done globally to <br>handle the relationships between the lines </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The method permits editing of the source <br>language using a general purpose text editor, and incremental <br>processing of changes without frequent <br>recompilation of entire routines </p></div></pre></html>
