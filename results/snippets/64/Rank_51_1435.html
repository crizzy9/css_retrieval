Design of Computer Simulation Experiments for Industrial Systems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The four experimental design problems are: <b>(1)</b> the <br>problem of stochastic convergence, (2) the problem <br>of factor selection, (3) the problem of motive <br>and (4) the many response problem </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The aim of this paper is to provide background <br>information on the existing literature on experimental <br>design techniques which may be applicable to the design <br>of computer simulation experiments for industrial <br>systems </p></div></pre></html>
