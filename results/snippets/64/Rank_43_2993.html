Occurrences of Cycling and Other Phenomena
Arising in a Class of Linear Programming Models</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This fact, plus several <br>other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason <br>that cycling is not known to occur more frequently <br>is the round-off errors in the computations perturb <br>the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at <br>least to prevent indefinite cycling) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems <br>which did not cycle </p></div></pre></html>
