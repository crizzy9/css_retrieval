On the Probability Distribution of the Values of Binary Trees</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The solution to the integral equation indicates that <br>using more advanced <b>algorithms</b> in the family makes <br>only minor <b>reductions</b> in the expected sorting effort, <br>but substantially reduces the variance in sorting <br>effort </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <br>empirical tests, as well as the analytical results, <br>are in agreement with previously published results for the <br>first moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform <br>distribution of branching ratio, and for the second moment <br>in the case of uniform distribution of branching <br>ratio </p></div></pre></html>
