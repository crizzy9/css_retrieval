Event Manipulation for Discrete Simulations
Requiring Large Numbers of Events</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The first part addresses <br>the familiar problem of event scheduling <b>efficiency</b> <br>when the number of scheduled events grows large </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Additional features <br>and problems dealt with include the proper handling <br>of simultaneous events; that certain events must be created, <br>scheduled, and executed at the same points <br>in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation <br>of such "zero-time" events are possible <br>and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event <br>counts is practical and economical; and that a <br>capability for handling "time-displaceable" events is desirable and possible </p></div></pre></html>
