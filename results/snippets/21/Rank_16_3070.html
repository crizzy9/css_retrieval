Hybrid Simulation Models of Computer Systems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The accuracy and <b>efficiency</b> of the <br>hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing <br>the result and <b>computational</b> costs of the hybrid model of <br>the example with those of an equivalent simulation-only <br>model </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In an example based on a simple hypothetical <br>computer system, discrete-event simulation is used <br>to model the arrival and activation of jobs, and a <br>central-server queueing network models the use of <br>system processors </p></div></pre></html>
