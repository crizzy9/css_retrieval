The Digital Simulation of River Plankton Population Dynamics</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>As an investigation <br>of the accuracy of the simulation methods, a simulation <br>of the actual population dynamics of Asterionella <br>in the Columbia River was made based on <b>approximations</b> <br>of conditions in that river </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This paper deals with the development of a <br>mathematical model for and the <b>digital</b> simulation <br>in Fortran IV of phytoplankton and zooplankton population <br>densities in a river using previously developed <br>rate expressions </p></div></pre></html>
