Estimation of Heart Parameters Using Skin Potential Measurements</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A fundamental problem of vector cardiography <br>is the estimation of the state of the heart on <br>the basis of skin potential measurements </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Then it is shown that the inverse <br>problem-that of determining electrical heart <br>parameters on the basis of skin potential measurements-may <br>be viewed as a nonlinear multipoint boundary <br>value problem </p></div></pre></html>
