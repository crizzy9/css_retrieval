Approximate Solution of Axially Symmetric Problems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A variety of physical problems in such diverse <br>fields as electrostatic field <b>theory,</b> heat <br>and ideal fluid flow, and stress concentration <b>theory</b> <br>reduce, under the assumption of axial symmetry, <br>to the study of an elliptic partial differential equation </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Dirichlet-type problems associated with this <br>equation are studied on regions whose boundaries <b>include</b> <br>a nondegenerate portion of the x-axis and exceedingly <br>accurate numerical methods are given for approximating solutions </p></div></pre></html>
