On the Complexity of Computing the Measure of U[ai, bi]</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The decision tree complexity of computing the <br>measure of the union of n (possibly overlapping) <br>intervals is shown to be (n log n), even if comparisons <br>between linear functions of the interval endpoints <br>are allowed </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The existence of an (n log n) <b>lower</b> bound <br>to determine whether any two of n real numbers <br>are within of each other is also demonstrated </p></div></pre></html>
