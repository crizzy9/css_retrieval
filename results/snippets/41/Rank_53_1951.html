Estimates of Distributions of Random Variables
for Certain Computer Communications Traffic Models</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Data were examined <br>from four operational multiaccess <b>systems,</b> and the model is shown to <br>be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the <br>same distribution independent of which of the four <b>systems</b> is being examined </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The model used is <br>elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that <br>generally are of <b>interest</b> in computer communications studies can be <br>decomposed into the elements of this model </p></div></pre></html>
