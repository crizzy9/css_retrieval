On Quadratic Adaptive Routing Algorithms</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>routing <b>algorithms,</b> adaptive routing, quadratic routing, <br>alternate routing, store-and-forward network, <br>distributed network, computer network, message switching </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>These <b>models</b> show that <br>adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary <br>conditions for an optimal routing, Adaptive routing tends <br>to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate <br>routes because it does not consider the impact of its <br>current routing decision on the future state of <br>the network </p></div></pre></html>
