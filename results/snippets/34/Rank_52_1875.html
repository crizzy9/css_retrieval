Polynomial and Spline Approximation by Quadratic Programming</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Two approaches <br>are presented, in each of which quadratic programming <br>is used to provide both the constraints on the derivatives <br>and the selection of the function which yields <br>the best fit </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The problem of approximation to a given function, <br>or of fitting a given set of data, where <br>the approximating function is required to have certain <br>of its derivations of specified sign over the <br>whole range of approximation, is studied </p></div></pre></html>
