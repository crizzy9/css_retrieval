Optimal Starting Approximations for Generating
Square Root for Slow or No Divide</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>On machine with slow or no division, it is preferable to <br>use an iterative scheme for the square <b>root</b> different from <br>the classical Heron scheme </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The problem of optimal initial <br>approximants is considered, and some optimal <b>polynomial</b> initial <br>approximations are tabulated </p></div></pre></html>
