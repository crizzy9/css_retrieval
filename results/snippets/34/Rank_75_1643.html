An Improvement to Iterative Methods of Polynomial Factorization</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Methods of <b>polynomial</b> factorization which <br>find the zeros one at a time require the division <br>of the <b>polynomial</b> by the accepted factor </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It is shown <br>how the accuracy of this division may be increased <br>by dividing in order of both ascending and descending <br>powers of the variable and choosing a crossover <br>point which minimizes a very simply calculated error criterion </p></div></pre></html>
