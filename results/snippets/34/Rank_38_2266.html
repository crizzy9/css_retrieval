A Highly Parallel Algorithm for Approximating
All Zeros of a Polynomial with Only Real Zeros</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An algorithm is described based on Newton's <br>method which simultaneously approximates all zeros <br>of a <b>polynomial</b> with only real zeros </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The algorithm, which <br>is conceptually suitable for parallel computation, <br>determines its own starting values so that convergence <br>to the zeros is guaranteed </p></div></pre></html>
