On the Application of the Process of Equalization
of Maxima to Obtain Rational Approximation 
to Certain Modified Bessel Functions</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The <br>aim of this paper is to investigate the limitations <br>of the applicability of certain extensions of the <br>algorithm to the case where the approximations are rational <br>as well as to present some numerical results </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>However, the <br>few results known in this domain show how efficient <br>the algorithm can be to obtain approximations with a <br>small error, much more than in the <b>polynomial</b> case, <br>in which the best approximation can be very nearly <br>approached directly by a series development </p></div></pre></html>
