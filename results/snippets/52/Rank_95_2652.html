Reduction of Compilation Costs Through Language Contraction</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The results suggest a function <br>which describes the effect of changes in the power of <br>a language on the compilation cost of an algorithm <br>expressed in that language: when features not actually <br>used by the algorithm are removed from the language, <br>the cost of compiling the algorithm decreases moderately, <br>but when features that are needed are removed, <br>the compilation cost increases sharply </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This <br>paper describes the use of <b>simulation</b> techniques <br>to predict the savings in compilation cost achievable <br>by such an approach </p></div></pre></html>
