The Effects of Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A study is made of the way in which asynchronous <br>time division multiplexing changes the stochastic <br>nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer <br>and, consequently, affects the performance <br>of a time-shared computer-communications system </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Analytical and <b>simulation</b> results are <br>based on the model of the computer-communications <br>system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem <br>with a single exponential server (the computer) </p></div></pre></html>
