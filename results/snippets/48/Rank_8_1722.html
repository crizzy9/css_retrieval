Methods of Convergence Improvement for Some Improper Integrals</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In the <b>numerical</b> integration of an improper <br>integral of the first kind, it is customary to <br>truncate the integral when the change yielded by the last <br>iteration is less than some predetermined constant </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In this paper, several <br>methods of convergence improvement are developed which greatly <br>improve convergence of some improper integrals, <br>including the integrals of rational polynomials </p></div></pre></html>
