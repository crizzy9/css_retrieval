Elimination of Special Functions from Differential Equations</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A set of ordinary differential equations which <br>contains mathematical functions requiring the <br>use of subroutines for <b>numerical</b> solution by electronic <br>computer, tabular <b>data</b> for <b>numerical</b> solution <br>by hand calculation or function generators when analog <br>methods are applied can sometimes be expanded <br>to an equivalent set of equations which do not contain <br>the functions </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Thus among those functions which can be eliminated <br>by this procedure are the trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, <br>exponential, and many other transcendental <br>functions </p></div></pre></html>
