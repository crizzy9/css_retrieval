Algorithms for Finding a Fundamental Set
of Cycles for an Undirected Linear Graph</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Our <b>algorithm</b> is slower than an <b>algorithm</b> presented <br>by Welch by a ratio of N/3 (N is the number of nodes) <br>but requires less storage </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Given the adjacency matrix of the graph, the <b>algorithm</b> <br>presented in this paper finds a spanning <br>tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles </p></div></pre></html>
