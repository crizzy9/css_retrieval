Computer Generation of Gamma Random Variates
with Non-integral Shape Parameters</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following <br>mix of procedures yields the best combination <br>of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when a is less than <br>1, use Johnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than a <br>and a is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when <br>a is greater than 5, use the probability switch <br>method </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>When the <b>shape</b> parameter, a, is integral, <br>generating gamma random variables with a digital <br>computer is straightforward </p></div></pre></html>
