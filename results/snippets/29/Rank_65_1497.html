On the Normalization Requirement of
Divisor in Divide- and- Correct Methods</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>) <br> It is found that the normalization requirement <br>could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors, <br>provided the magnitude of the character next to <br>the leading character of the divisor is known </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Also considered is <br>the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an <br>increase on the <b>number</b> of corrections on the quotient <br>estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division </p></div></pre></html>
