A New Uniform Pseudorandom Number Generator</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A new multiplicative congruential pseudorandom <br>number generator is discussed, in which the <br>modulus is the largest <b>prime</b> within accumulator capacity <br>and the multiplier is a primitive root of that <br>prime </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This generator passes the usual statistical <br>tests and in addition the least significant bits <br>appear to be as random as the most significant bits-a <br>property which generators having modulus 2^k do <br>not possess </p></div></pre></html>
