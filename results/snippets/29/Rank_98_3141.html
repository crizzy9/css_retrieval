An Improved Algorithm for Decentralized Extrema-Finding
in Circular Configurations of Processes</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective <br>message extinction in order to achieve an average <b>number</b> of <br>message passes of order (n log n) rather than O(n2) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This note presents an improvement to LeLann's <br>algorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely <br>numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central <br>controller exists and the <b>number</b> of processes is not known a priori </p></div></pre></html>
