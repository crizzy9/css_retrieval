The Use of Quadratic Residue Research</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>It is shown that for some classes of <b>prime</b> numbers <br>the complement of the set of quadratic residues can easily be determined and <br>hence the entire table of size p, where p is that <b>prime</b> <b>number,</b> can be searched </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The search size, because <br>of the property of quadratic residues, is limited to one half of <br>the storage table </p></div></pre></html>
