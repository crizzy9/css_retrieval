A Note on Storage Fragmentation and Program Segmentation</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The main purpose of this paper is the presentation <br>of some of the results of a <b>series</b> of simulation <br>experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Two different types of storage fragmentation <br>are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the <br>loss in storage utilization caused by the inability <br>to make use of all available storage after it has been <br>fragmented into a large <b>number</b> of separate blocks; <br>and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization <br>caused by rounding up a request for storage, <br>rather than allocating only the exact <b>number</b> of words required </p></div></pre></html>
