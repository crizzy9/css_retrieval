Anomalous Behavior of the Fifty-Percent
Rule in Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>On the basis of the simulation <br>data and the derivation, it is hypothesized <br>that the anomalous behavior results from the combined <br>effects of systematic placement and the statistics <br>of the release <b>process</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>For <br>non-Markovian release <b>processes,</b> the extent of the <br>correlation between allocation order and release order <br>varies approximately inversely with the coefficient <br>of variation of the memory residence time distribution </p></div></pre></html>
