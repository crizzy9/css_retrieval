A Queuing Model of a Multiprogrammed
Computer with a Two-Level Storage System</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The results are presented of an analysis of <br>a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer <br>system with a two-level storage <b>system</b> in which there <br>is sequential dependency of accesses between the <br>devices </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Some numerical results are given which <br>quantify the gains in CPU utilization obtainable <br>by multiprogramming in the presence of this <b>type</b> of storage <b>system</b> </p></div></pre></html>
