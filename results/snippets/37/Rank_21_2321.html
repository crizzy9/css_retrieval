On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Future systems that combine computers, digital <br>terminals, and communications equipment present <br>design optimization problems that require reconsideration <br>of the traditional functional responsibilities <br>of the respective subsystems </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>When specifying these interfaces, <br>consideration must be given to problems of coordination, <br>synchronization, error control, signaling, <b>stream</b> <br>multiplexing, and switch control, in addition to minimizing <br>the technological interdependence of specific <br>subsystem designs </p></div></pre></html>
