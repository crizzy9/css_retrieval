The Effects of Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A study is made of the way in which asynchronous <br>time division multiplexing changes the stochastic <br>nature of the arrival <b>process</b> from a user to the computer <br>and, consequently, affects the performance <br>of a time-shared computer-communications <b>system</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Analytical results include a general description of the <br>output <b>process</b> of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions <br>under which this output <b>process</b> is approximately Poisson </p></div></pre></html>
