Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area <br>(space), the time required to identify a <b>message</b> as a nonmember of the <br>given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The reduction in <br>space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of <br>errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, <br>applications in which a large amount of <b>data</b> is involved and a core resident <br>hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods </p></div></pre></html>
