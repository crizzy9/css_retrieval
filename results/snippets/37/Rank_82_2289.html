Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A major challenge <br>in the effective use of cellular arrays for the <br>solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms <br>that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, <br>especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently <br>serial </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard <br>type interconnection of identical modules <br>(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of <br>memory and a small amount of combinational logic, <br>and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors <br>in the array </p></div></pre></html>
