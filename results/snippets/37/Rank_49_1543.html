Computer Formulation of the Equations of Motion Using Tensor Notation</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Since this operation involves a formulation in <br>terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients, <br>it provides a good demonstration of a computer's <br>capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the <br>formulation <b>process</b> which normally precedes the <br>numerical <b>data</b> processing stage </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>To illustrate the <br>techniques involved, a digital computer has been used <br>to derive the equations of motion of a point mass <br>in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate <b>system</b> </p></div></pre></html>
