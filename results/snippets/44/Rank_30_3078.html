Analysis of the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Analytical results, related to the availability <br>of a <b>computer</b> system constructed of unreliable <br>processors, are presented in this paper </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Since many physical <br>systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov <br>processes, the potential range of application of these techniques <br>is much wider than the problem of availability <br>analyzed here </p></div></pre></html>
