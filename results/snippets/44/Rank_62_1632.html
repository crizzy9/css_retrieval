Programming the Tabular Method of Analysis
of Variance for Factorial Experiments </h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The ease of programming the tabular method of <b>analysis</b> <br>of variance for complete factorial experiments <br>in a FORTRAN language is demonstrated </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In this method, <br>the total sum of squares is partitioned into <br>orthogonal single degree of freedom sums of squares; <br>main effect and interaction sums of squares are <br>then obtained by appropriate pooling of the single degree <br>of freedom sums of squares </p></div></pre></html>
