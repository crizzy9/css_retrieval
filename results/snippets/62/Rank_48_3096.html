An Optimal Method for Deletion in One-Sided Height-Balanced Trees</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>It is shown that deletion of <br>an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished <br>in O(logn) operations, where n is the number of nodes <br>in the tree </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Moreover the method is optimal in <br>the sense that its <b>complexity</b> cannot be reduced in order <br>of magnitude </p></div></pre></html>
