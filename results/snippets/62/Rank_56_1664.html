An Algorithm for Deriving the Equations of
Mathematical Physics by Symbolic Manipulation</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>To derive these equations by this method, the <br>user need know only the coordinate transformation <br>equations <b>relating</b> the curvilinear coordinates of interest <br>to an orthogonal Cartesian triad </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>When this <br>program is used and the coordinate transformation equations <br>are supplied as input, the computer will <br>derive the Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity <br>equation </p></div></pre></html>
