Parallel Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>By this is meant that serial <br>algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which <br>consist of several subtasks which can be computed <br>without knowledge of the <b>results</b> of the other subtasks </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This paper is dedicated to the proposition that, <br>in order to take full advantage for real-time <br>computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be <br>expected to be available in the near future, much <br>of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more <br>"parallel" form </p></div></pre></html>
