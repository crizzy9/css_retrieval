Pattern Width at a Given Angle</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The <b>results</b> consist of a set-theoretic <br>definition of width-at-angle, a theorem <b>relating</b> <br>it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions <br>of alternate widths </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>That the pattern feature "width as a function <br>of angle" possesses several possible interpretations <br>is demonstrated in this paper, which is a review of <br>the width concept in pattern recognition and the <br>geometrical concept itself </p></div></pre></html>
