On the Complexity of Computing the Measure of U[ai, bi]</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The decision tree <b>complexity</b> of computing the <br>measure of the union of n (possibly overlapping) <br>intervals is shown to be (n log n), even if comparisons <br>between linear functions of the interval endpoints <br>are allowed </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>These <br>problems provide an excellent opportunity for <br>discussing the effects of the computational model on <br>the ease of analysis and on the <b>results</b> produced </p></div></pre></html>
