On the Optimal Detection of Curves in Noisy Pictures</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The method described is suitable for <b>parallel</b> <br>processing because the operations relative to each <br>state can be computed in <b>parallel,</b> and the number <br>of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or <br>to log2 N if the approximate method is used) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The relation <br>between the structure of the figure of merit and <br>the <b>complexity</b> of the optimization process is then discussed </p></div></pre></html>
