Problems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Using a generalization of Newton's method, a nonlinear <br>parabolic equation of the form U(t)-U(xx)=g(U) <br>and a nonlinear elliptic equation U(xx)+U(yy)=exp(U) <br>are solved numerically Comparison of these <b>results</b> <br>with <b>results</b> obtained using the Picard iteration procedure <br>show that in many cases the quisi linearization <br>method offers substantial advantages in both time and accuracy </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>CACM April, 1961 </p></div></pre></html>
