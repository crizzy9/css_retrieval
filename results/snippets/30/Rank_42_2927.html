Some New Upper Bounds on the Generation of Prime Numbers</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Use of preprocessing techniques <br>involving space-time and additive-multiplicative <br>tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to O(N/log logN) <br>and the bit complexity to O(N logN log log logN) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Given an integer N, what is the computational <br>complexity of finding all the primes less than <br>N? A modified sieve of Eratosthenes using doubly linked <br>lists yields an algorithm of O(N) arithmetic <br>complexity </p></div></pre></html>
