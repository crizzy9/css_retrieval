Optimal Shift Strategy for a Block-Transfer CCD Memory</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The bits iin the shift registers <br>are numbered 0 to N - 1, and blocks of N bits are <br>always transferred, always starting at bit 0 </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>For the purposes of this paper, a block-transfer <br>CCD memory is composed of serial shift registers <br>whose shift rate can vary, but which have a definite minimum <br>shift rate (the refresh rate) and a definite <br>maximum shift rate </p></div></pre></html>
