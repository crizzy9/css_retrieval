Computer Representation of Planar Regions by Their Skeletons</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Any region can be regarded as a union of maximal <br>neighborhoods of its points, and can be specified <br>by the centers and radii of these neighborhoods; this <br>set is a sort of"skeleton" of the region </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Moreover, the skeleton representation <br>seems to have advantages when it is <br>necessary to <b>determine</b> repeatedly whether points are inside <br>or outside the region, or to perform set-theoretic <br>operations on regions </p></div></pre></html>
