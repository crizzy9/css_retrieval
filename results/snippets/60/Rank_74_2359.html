An Improved Index Sequential Access Method Using Hashed Overflow</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Using hashed overflow, <br>the time to locate a record is dependent not on the <b>total</b> <br>volume of overflow records as in conventional <br>ISAM, but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>These conditions are: <br>long overflow chains with significant <br>overflow; lack of tight <b>disk</b> space constraints; record <br>keys which are small compared to the <b>total</b> record <br>size; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed <br>to the sequential mode </p></div></pre></html>
