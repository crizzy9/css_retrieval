A Time- and Space- Efficient Garbage Compaction Algorithm</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An algorithm is described <br>here which accomplishes this task in linear time <br>relative to the size of the storage area, and in a space <br>of the order of one bit for each pointer </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <br>algorithm operates by reversibly encoding the situation <br>(that a collection of locations point to a single <br>location) by a linear list, emanating from the pointed-to <br>location, passing through the pointing locations, <br>and terminating with the pointed-to location's transplanted contents </p></div></pre></html>
