Computing Connected Components on Parallel Computers</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>We present a <b>parallel</b> algorithm which uses n2 <b>processors</b> to find the connected <br>components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>An <br>O(log2n) time bound also can be achieved using only n$n/$log2n)) <b>processors</b> </p></div></pre></html>
