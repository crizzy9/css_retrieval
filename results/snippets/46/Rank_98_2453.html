Information Theory Applied to the Conversion
of Decision Tables to Computer Programs</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Compared <br>to the optimal algorithm of Reinwald and Soland, <br>this algorithm is easy to code and takes a much smaller <br>translation time; it is thus felt that it is <br>more useful in practice </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The algorithm is well suited for <br>manual conversion of decision tables to flowcharts </p></div></pre></html>
