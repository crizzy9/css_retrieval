One Way of Estimating Frequencies of Jumps in a Program</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>For the segmentation of a program it is useful <br>to have a reasonable estimation of the values <br>of S(ij), where S(ij) is the mean value of the number <br>of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th <br>instruction in the run time </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In <br>the first part of the paper, using the theory of the <br>Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation <br>of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways <br>of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given </p></div></pre></html>
