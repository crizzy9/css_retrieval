Compressed Tries</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>It has the same underlying <br>m-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is <br>a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the <br>nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold <br>a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are <br>only one bit long </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In the analysis part of the <br>paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the <br>retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections <br>of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage <br>requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits </p></div></pre></html>
