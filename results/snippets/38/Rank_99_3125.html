Global Optimization by Suppression of Partial Redundancies</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>We propose to do both at once and <br>to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost <br>loop in which it is invariant </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly <br>linear with the size of the program, and that it leads <br>to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time </p></div></pre></html>
