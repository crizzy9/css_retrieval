A Graph Formulation of a School Scheduling Algorithm</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The object of this paper is to generalize <br>the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph <br>to include the weighting of nodes, to present an <br>approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest <br>strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the <br>application of this algorithm to the solution of <br>school scheduling and exam scheduling problems </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>One logical extension of <br>the previous work is the introduction of variable <br>length examinations where W(I) is the number of periods <br>for exam I </p></div></pre></html>
