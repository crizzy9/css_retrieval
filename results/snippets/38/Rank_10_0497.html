Further Remarks on Line Segment Curve-Fitting Using Dynamic Programming</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The problem <br>comprises the determination, given N, of the <br>N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and <br>the corresponding line segments, that give the <br>best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Bellman confined himself primarily to the <br>analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however, <br>how the solution of the equation derived for each <br>particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to <br>a discrete search </p></div></pre></html>
