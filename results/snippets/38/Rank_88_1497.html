On the Normalization Requirement of
Divisor in Divide- and- Correct Methods</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>) <br> It is found that the normalization requirement <br>could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors, <br>provided the magnitude of the character next to <br>the leading character of the divisor is known </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This analysis is made subject to the condition <br>that not more than one correction is required <br>to obtain the true quotient character, from the trial <br>estimate got from the division of a two-precision <br>segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded <br>single-precision divisor </p></div></pre></html>
