Decomposability, Instabilities, and
Saturation in Multiprogramming Systems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>It is based on a technique of variable <br>aggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable <br>system, both borrowed from Econometrics </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This approach <br>is taken in order to identify in multiprogramming <br>paging systems (i) unstable regimes of operations and (ii) <br>critical computing loads which bring the system <br>into states of saturation </p></div></pre></html>
