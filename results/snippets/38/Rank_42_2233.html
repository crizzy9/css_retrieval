Signature Simulation and Certain Cryptographic Codes</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>For example, we have turned the <b>entire</b> process of <br>simulated encoding by various schemes over to the <br>machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic <br>codes; we have also encoded various messages by <br>hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to <br>obtain their signatures </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The work now completed with the help <br>of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies <br>of the Beale cyphers and various <b>types</b> of simulations </p></div></pre></html>
