Methods for Analyzing Data from Computer Simulation Experiments</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The results of the simulated activity under each <br>plan are subjected to an F-test, two multiple comparison <br>methods, and a multiple ranking method </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The paper adopts the position that the particular <br>technique of analysis (possibly not any one of the above) <br>chosen by the experimenter should be an expression <br>of his experimental objective: The F-test tests the homogeneity <br>of the plans; multiple comparison methods <br>quantify their differences; and multiple ranking methods <br>directly identify the one best plan or best <br>plans </p></div></pre></html>
