Thinning Algorithms on Rectangular, Hexagonal, and Triangular Arrays</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>It is found that the algorithm <b>operating</b> <br>with the triangular array is the most sensitive <br>to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield <br>a thinned image with an overall reduced number of <br>points </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The approach to the <br>development of each algorithm is the same </p></div></pre></html>
