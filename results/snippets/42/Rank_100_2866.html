Proving Monitors</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>These two <b>techniques</b> are defined, discussed, and applied <br>to examples to prove properties such as freedom <br>from indefinitely repeated overtaking or unnecessary waiting <br>upper bounds on queue lengths, and historical <br>behavior </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Interesting scheduling and sequential properties <br>of monitors can be proved by using state variables <br>which record the monitor's history and by defining extended <br>proof rules for their wait and signal operations </p></div></pre></html>
