Median Split Trees: A Fast Lookup Technique for Frequently Occuring Keys</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A median split tree (MST) uses <br>the <b>lexical</b> median of a node's descendents as its split <br>value to force the search tree to be perfectly <br>balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation <br>of the tree and high search speed </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which <br>contains two key values-a node value which is <br>a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split <br>value which partitions the remaining keys (with <br>respect to their <b>lexical</b> ordering) between the left and <br>right subtrees </p></div></pre></html>
