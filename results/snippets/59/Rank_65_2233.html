Signature Simulation and Certain Cryptographic Codes</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>For example, we have turned the entire process of <br>simulated encoding by various schemes over to the <br>machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic <br>codes; we have also encoded various messages by <br>hand, using different texts and a variety of <b>methods</b> to <br>obtain their signatures </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>For the benefit <br>of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the <br>second cypher employs a specified document whose <br>words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters <br>of these <b>words</b> are sought out at random to <br>match the letters of these <b>words</b> are sought out at random <br>to match the letters of the clear text or message </p></div></pre></html>
