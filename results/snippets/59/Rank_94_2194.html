How To Keep the Addresses Short</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>An algorithm is presented for minimizing the <br>sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced <br>by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of <br>each computer instruction is assumed to be either <br>"long" or "short" ("long," if the memory location addressed <br>is more than a predetermined distance from <br>the current location; "short," otherwise), and (2) <br>there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings <br>(origins) are separated by prespecified amounts </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This <br>paper demonstrates that a wide class of <b>problems</b> of <br>this type can be formulated as covering <b>problems</b> <br>solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operations <br>on the column vectors of a ternary matrix </p></div></pre></html>
