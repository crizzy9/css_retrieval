Anomalies with Variable Partition Paging Algorithms</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>One type of anomaly, for example, concerns <br>the fact that, with certain reference strings <br>and <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms,</b> an increase in mean memory allocation <br>may result in an increase in fault rate </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Two <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms,</b> are examined in terms of their <br>anomaly potential, and reference string examples <br>of various anomalies are presented </p></div></pre></html>
