On Shrinking Binary Picture Patterns</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The <br>principal features of this method are the very small <br>window employed (two-by-two elements), the <b>parallel</b> <br>nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking <br>any pattern, regardless of the complexity of <br>its configuration </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A <b>parallel</b> processing algorithm for shrinking <br>binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, <br>one for each pattern, is presented </p></div></pre></html>
