Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A major challenge <br>in the effective use of cellular arrays for the <br>solution of graph problems is the determination of <b>algorithms</b> <br>that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, <br>especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently <br>serial </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>For example, the adjacency <br>matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; <br>each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array, <br>and typical row and column operations are readily <br>implemented by simple cell logic </p></div></pre></html>
