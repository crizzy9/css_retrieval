Thinning Algorithms on Rectangular, Hexagonal, and Triangular Arrays</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Pictorial <br>results produced by each of the <b>algorithms</b> are presented <br>and the relative performances of the <b>algorithms</b> <br>are compared </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It is found that the algorithm operating <br>with the triangular array is the most sensitive <br>to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield <br>a thinned image with an overall reduced number of <br>points </p></div></pre></html>
