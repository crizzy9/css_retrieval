Numerical Properties of the Ritz-Trefftz Algorithm for Optimal Control</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The algorithm represents a modification of <br>the Ritz direct method and is designed to improve <br>the speed of solution and the storage requirements to <br>the point where real-time implementation becomes <br>feasible </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The first concern of the paper is to describe the <br>algorithm and establish its properties as a valid <br>and useful numerical technique </p></div></pre></html>
