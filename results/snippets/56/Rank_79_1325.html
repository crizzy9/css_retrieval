of the Clinical Electrocardiogram</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Current <br>attempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic <br>capabilities of the present system are particularly concerned <br>with increasing the fidelity of the adaptive <br>matched filters, the development of three dimensional pattern analysis, <br>the analysis of parallel electrocardiographer-computer <br>diagnostic interaction, and a <b>study</b> of the possibility <br>of introducing major, tree-like branching decisions <br>early in the diagnostic process </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It seems likely that efforts of this sort will lead <br>to a satisfactory solution to the problem of the <br>automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms </p></div></pre></html>
