An Algorithm for Minimizing Backboard Wiring Functions</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The algorithm <br>finds a local minimum of F by evaluating the set {Delta <br>F} of the increments corresponding to a certain <br>set of exchanges of two elementshen the exchange <br>corresponding to the least negative increment of <br>{Delta F} is performed </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The process is iterated and stopped <br>when the set of the increments is a positive <br>or empty set, which, it is proved, corresponds to a <br>minimum </p></div></pre></html>
