Internal and Tape Sorting Using the Replacement-Selection Technique</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The technique is shown to <br>be applicable for the first stage of a <b>generalized</b> sort <br>program (the formation of initial strings) as <br>well as for sorting records within a memory storage (an <br>internal sort) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It is shown that given N records <br>in memory storage, records are sequenced using 1+log2 <br>N <b>tests</b> per record, that initial string lengths <br>will average 2N for random input records, and that reading, <br>writing and processing can be accomplished <br>simultaneously if the computer permits such overlap </p></div></pre></html>
