A Multiple-Precision Division Algorithm</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Depending upon the algebraic relationship of the first <br>two ciphers of the divisor, one or at most two adjustments to the original <br>divisor and dividend must be performed before the division operation can be <br>initiated </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The uniqueness of this method will cause each trial cipher in the <br>quotient to be either equal to or one greater than its final replacement </p></div></pre></html>
