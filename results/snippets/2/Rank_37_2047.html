Incorporating Origin Shifts into the QR
Algorithm for Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrices</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The QR iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can <br>be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Both <br>methods have drawbacks: the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small <br>eigenvalues, while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and <br>thereby retard the convergence </p></div></pre></html>
