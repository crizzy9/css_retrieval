Design of Tree Structures for Efficient Querying</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>As a practical application <br>of such a model this paper considers the design of <br>a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation <br>of data and shows that essentially the <br>same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal <br>search tree or a bit-vector tree </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The process of locating the desired responses <br>can be represented by a tree search model </p></div></pre></html>
