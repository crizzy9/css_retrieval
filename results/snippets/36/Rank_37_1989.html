Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis <br>of natural <b>language</b> sentences is described </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Structure-building <br>actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering, <br>restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce <br>deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a <br>transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a <br>powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take <br>advantage of semantic information to guide the <b>parsing</b> </p></div></pre></html>
