Asymmetric Memory Hierarchies</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A study is presented of some of the <b>system</b> <br>implications of memory hierarchies in which the <br>backing or <b>secondary</b> store has a very small read time, <br>relative of both the time required for writing <br>and to the read time of conventional backing storage <br>devices </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Several analytic <b>models</b> are introduced, <br>and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate in <br>ways which differ from those of more conventional <br>hierarchies </p></div></pre></html>
