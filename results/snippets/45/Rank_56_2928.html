Hardware Estimation of a Process' Primary Memory Requirements</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This <br>primary memory requirement estimate was employed <br>in an experimental version of Multics to control the <br>level of multiprogramming in the <b>system</b> and to bill <br>for memory usage </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A minor hardware extension to the Honeywell <br>6180 processor is demonstrated to allow the primary <br>memory requirements of a process in Multics to be approximated </p></div></pre></html>
