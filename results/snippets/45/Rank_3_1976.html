Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Through the use of redundancy and storing <br>keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations <br>of <b>secondary</b> <b>index</b> values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve <br>all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of <br>fields by a single access to an <b>index</b> file, although each bucket may <br>be used for many combinations of values and a combination of <br>buckets may be required for a given query </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The method which, in its <br>degenerate case, becomes the conventional <b>secondary</b> <b>index</b> filing <br>scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination <br>of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination <br>of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection <br>of key sets each qualified for one <b>secondary</b> <b>index</b> field <br>only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an <b>index</b> <br>field appearing in a query has very few possible values </p></div></pre></html>
