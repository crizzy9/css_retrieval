Interference in Multiprocessor Computer Systems with Interleaved Memory</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The model <br>of the limiting behavior of the <b>system</b> yields approximate <br>results for the simple model and also suggests <br>that the results are valid for a much larger class of <b>models,</b> <br>including those more nearly like real systems <br>that the simple model are tested against some measurements <br>of program behavior and simulations of systems <br>using memory references from real programs </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The limiting <br>value is derived for the relative degree of memory interference <br>as the <b>system</b> size increases </p></div></pre></html>
