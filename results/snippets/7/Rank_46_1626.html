Structure of a LISP System Using Two-Level Storage</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Described in this paper are a number <br>of <b>techniques</b> that have been used to build a LISP <br>system utilizing a drum for its principal storage medium, <br> with a surprisingly low time penalty for use <br>of this slow storage device </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <b>techniques</b> <b>include</b> <br>careful segmentation of system <b>programs,</b> allocation <br>of virtual memory to allow address arithmetic for type <br>determination, and a special algorithm for building <br>reasonably linearized lists </p></div></pre></html>
