An Efficient Context-free Parsing Algorithm</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In an empirical comparison it appears <br>to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up <b>algorithms</b> studied by Griffiths <br>and Petrick </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It has a time bound proportional to <br>n^3 (where n is the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has a <br>n^2 bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a large <br>class of grammars, which seems to <b>include</b> most practical context-free <br>programming language grammars </p></div></pre></html>
