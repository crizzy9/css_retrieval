Analysis of an Algorithm for Real Time Garbage Collection</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A real time garbage collection system avoids <br>suspending the operations of a list processor <br>for the long times that garbage collection normally requires <br>by performing garbage collection on a second <br>processor in parallel with list processing operations, <br>or on a single processor time-shared with them </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The average behavior of the program <br>is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case <br>performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also <br>suitable for measuring the typical behavior of <br>the algorithm </p></div></pre></html>
