Reduction of a Band-Symmetric Generalized Eigenvalue Problem</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The round-off error in the calculation <br>of C is of the same order as the sum of the errors at <br>each of the n/m steps of the algorithm, the latter <br>errors being largely determined by the condition of B with respect to inversion </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>If n is the <br>order of the matrix and m the bandwidth, the <b>matrices</b> <br>A and B are partitioned into m-by-m blocks; and <br>the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks </p></div></pre></html>
