Multi-Tape and Infinite-State Automata -- A Survey</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p><b>Intermediate</b> machines <br>can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memory <br>to a finite-state <b>machine</b> and then performing any <br>or all of the following: (1) restrict the manner in <br>which the unbounded portion of the memory can be <br>accessed, (2) bound the number of steps allowed for a <br>computation by some increasing recursive function <br>of the length of the input, (3) restrict the total amount <br>of memory available in the same manner </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It is felt that the machines <br>in this category are as closely related to <br>digital computers as either the finite automata or the <br>unrestricted Turing machines </p></div></pre></html>
