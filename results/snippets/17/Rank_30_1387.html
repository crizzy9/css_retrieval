Solution of Systems of Polynomial Equations By Elimination</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The method, by <br>itself, appears in appropriate, however, in the solution <br>of large systems of equation due to the explosive <br>growth in the <b>intermediate</b> equations and the hazards <br>which arise when the coefficients are truncated </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>It is found <br>that the method is very effective in the case <br>of small systems, where it yields all solutions without <br>the need for initial estimates </p></div></pre></html>
