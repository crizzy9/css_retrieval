Analysis of an Algorithm for Real Time Garbage Collection</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>These techniques <br>are shown to require at most twice as much processing <br>power as <b>regular</b> garbage collectors, if they are <br>used efficiently </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A real time garbage collection system avoids <br>suspending the operations of a list processor <br>for the long times that garbage collection normally requires <br>by performing garbage collection on a second <br>processor in parallel with list processing operations, <br>or on a single processor time-shared with them </p></div></pre></html>
