Event Manipulation for Discrete Simulations
Requiring Large Numbers of Events</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Additional features <br>and problems dealt with include the proper handling <br>of simultaneous <b>events;</b> that certain <b>events</b> must be created, <br>scheduled, and executed at the same points <br>in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation <br>of such "zero-time" <b>events</b> are possible <br>and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event <br>counts is practical and economical; and that a <br>capability for handling "time-displaceable" <b>events</b> is desirable and possible </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The first part addresses <br>the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiency <br>when the number of scheduled <b>events</b> grows large </p></div></pre></html>
