Optimal Conversion of Extended-Entry
Decision Tables with General Cost Criteria</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A general dynamic programming algorithm for converting <br>limited, extended, or mixed entry decision <br>tables to optimal decision trees is presented which can <br>take into account rule frequencies or probabilities, <br>minimum time and/or space cost criteria, common action <br>sets, compressed rules and ELSE rules, sequencing <br>constraints on condition tests, excludable combinations <br>of conditions, certain ambiguities, and interrupted <br>rule masking </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>CACM April, 1978 </p></div></pre></html>
