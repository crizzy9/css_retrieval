A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating <br>the usefulness of the model </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching <br>environment where stored entities (documents) <br>are compared with each other or with incoming patterns <br>(search requests), it appears that the best indexing <br>(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away <br>from the others as possible; in these circumstances <br>the value of an indexing system may be expressible <br>as a function of the density of the object space; <br>in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely <br>with space density </p></div></pre></html>
