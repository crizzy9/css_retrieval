Synchronization with Eventcounts and Sequencers</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using <br>abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes <br>to control the ordering of <b>events</b> directly, rather than using mutual <br>exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control <br>ordering of <b>events</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The relationship of the mechanism <br>to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular, <br>eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement <br>of information matters </p></div></pre></html>
