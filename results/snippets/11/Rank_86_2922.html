Two-Level Control Structure for Nondeterministic Programming</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of <br>the nondeterministic formulation of search processes <br>on one <b>level</b> (the attempt <b>level),</b> deferring the coordination <br>of problem solving efforts to another (the <br>choice <b>level)</b> </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The main <br>advantage on this approach is the localization <br>of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the <br>tree keeps track of the state of the computation <br>as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated, <br>holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate <br>the available alternatives </p></div></pre></html>
