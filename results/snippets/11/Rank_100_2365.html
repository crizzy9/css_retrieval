Matrix Computations with Fortran and Paging</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The efficiency of conventional Fortran programs <br>for matrix computations can often be improved <br>by reversing the order of nested loops </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Such modifications <br>produce modest savings in many common situations <br>and very significant savings for large problems run <br>under an operating system which uses paging </p></div></pre></html>
