Register Allocation Via Usage Counts</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This paper introduces the notion of usage counts, <br>shows how usage counts can be developed by <br>algorithms that eliminate redundant computations, and <br>describes how usage counts can provide the basis <br>for register allocation </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The paper compares register <br>allocation based on usage counts to other commonly <br>used register allocation techniques, and presents evidence <br>which shows that the usage count technique <br>is significantly better than these other techniques </p></div></pre></html>
