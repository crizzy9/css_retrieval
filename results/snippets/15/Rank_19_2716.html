Optimizing the Performance of a Relational Algebra Database Interface</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>SQUIRAL seeks to minimize query <br>response time and space utilization by: (1) performing <br>global query <b>optimization,</b> (2) exploiting disjoint <br>and pipelined concurrency, (3) coordinating sort orders <br>in temporary relations, (4) employing directory <br>analysis, and (5) maintaining locality in page references </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Codd's relational algebra are presented, and <br>a methodology for composing them to optimize the <br>performance of a particular user query is described </p></div></pre></html>
