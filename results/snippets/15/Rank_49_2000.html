A Variation of the Goodman-Lance Method for
the Solution of Two-Point Boundary Value Problems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A recently published method for the interpolative <br>solution of nonlinear equations is improved, <br>and applied to give a significant variation of the Goodman-Lance <br>method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution <br>of optimal control problems in the Euler-Lagrange formulation </p></div></pre></html>
