Least Squares Fitting of Planes to Surfaces Using Dynamic Programming</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In the present paper successive <br>models are developed to extend the method to the <br>fitting of broken plane segments to surfaces z=g(x,y) <b>defined</b> <br>over certain <b>types</b> of subareas of the (x,y)-space </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Dynamic programming has recently been used <br>by Stone, by Bellman and by Gluss to determine the <br>closet fit of broken line segments to a curve in an <br>interval under the constraint that the number of <br>segments is fixed </p></div></pre></html>
