An Efficient, Incremental, Automatic Garbage Collector</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>This paper describes a new way of solving <br>the storage reclamation problem for a system such <br>as Lisp that allocates storage automatically from a <br>heap, and does not require the <b>programmer</b> to give <br>any indication that particular items are no longer useful <br>or accessible </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>A reference count scheme for <br>reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing, <br>compacting, copying scheme to reorganize <br>all storage at the users discretion are proposed </p></div></pre></html>
