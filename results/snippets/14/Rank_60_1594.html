An Algorithm for Generating Permutations</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Only the previously generated permutation, <br>the constant K, and a temporary index are needed </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>By continuing <br>in this manner, <b>applications</b> of the algorithm will generate <br>all (K-1)! circular orderings, or since each <br>circular ordering yields K permutations the <br>algorithm generates all K! permutations </p></div></pre></html>
