The Conversion of Limited-Entry Decision Tables
to Optimal and Near-Optimal Flowcharts: Two New 
Algorithms</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Both <b>algorithms</b> are compared with existing <br>ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision <br>table derived from a real case </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The <b>algorithms</b> are first <br>derived for treating decision tables not containing <br>an ELSE-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm <br>is shown to be equally valid for tables including <br>such a rule </p></div></pre></html>
