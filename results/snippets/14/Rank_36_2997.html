Convex Hulls of Finite Sets of Poin ts in Two and Three Dimensions</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in two <br>and three dimensions can be determined with O(n <br>log n) operations </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Since any convex hull algorithm requires at <br>least O(n log n) operations, the time complexity of the <br>proposed <b>algorithms</b> is <b>optimal</b> within a multiplicative <br>constant </p></div></pre></html>
