Experiments with Some Algorithms that Find
Central Solutions for Pattern Classification</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The traditional methods <b>find</b> a hyperplane which separates all <br>points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered <br>in the empty space between the two classes </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Three <b>algorithms</b> which are defined in the paper are found to be <br>quite good </p></div></pre></html>
