Optimal His togram Matching by Monotone Gray Level Transformation</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>The objective <br>is to <b>find</b> a transformed digital picture of <br>a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors <br>between the gray level his togram of the transformed <br>picture and that of a reference picture is minimized </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This paper investigates the problem of <b>optimal</b> <br>his togram matching using monotone gray level <br>transformation, which always assigns all picture points <br>of a given gray level i to another gray level <br>T(i) such that if i > j, then T(i) > T(j) </p></div></pre></html>
