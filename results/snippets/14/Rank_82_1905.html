The Simplex Method of Linear Programming Using LU Decomposition</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Standard computer <b>implementations</b> of Dantzig's <br>simplex method for linear programming are based <br>upon forming the inverse of the basic matrix and updating <br>the inverse after every step of the method </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>This paper gives the theoretical background <br>for an implementation which is based upon the LU decomposition, <br>computed with row interchanges, of the <br>basic matrix </p></div></pre></html>
