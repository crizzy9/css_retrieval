Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A major challenge <br>in the effective use of cellular arrays for the <br>solution of graph problems is the determination of <b>algorithms</b> <br>that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, <br>especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently <br>serial </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Straightforward <br>cellular <b>implementations</b> of the well-known <br>serial <b>algorithms</b> for these problems require about n <br>steps, and noncellular <b>implementations</b> require from <br>n^2 to n^3 steps </p></div></pre></html>
