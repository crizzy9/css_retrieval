List Processing in Real Time on a Serial Computer</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>Classical <b>implementations</b> of list processing systems <br>lack this property because allocating a list cell <br>from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process <br>requires time proportional to the heap size <br>to finish </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>Finally, the system requires <br>the same average time, and not more than twice <br>the space, of a classical implementation, and those <br>space requirements can be reduced to approximately <br>classical proportions by compact list representation </p></div></pre></html>
