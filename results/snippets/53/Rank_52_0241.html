Machine Calculation of Moments of a Probability Distribution</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>A method is presented for the calculation on a <br>machine of the moments of a <b>probability</b> distribution, <br>necessitating little more than n additions and n references <br>to memory for each moment, instead of the <br>minimum of n multiplication, 2n additions, and 2n references <br>to memory required by the most straightforward <br>method (where n is the number of entries in the <b>probability</b> <br>distribution) </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The method is directly applicable <br>when a tabulated distribution exists, as when it has <br>been computed by repeated convolution; but in this <br>case it conserves both time and accuracy </p></div></pre></html>
