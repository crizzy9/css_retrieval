A Simple Algorithm for Computing the Generalized Inverse of a Matrix</h2><div>Snippet 1:<p>In the second case the algorithm <br>yields the ordinary least squares transformation <b>matrix</b> <br>INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding <br>the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly </p></div><div>Snippet 2:<p>The generalized inverse of a <b>matrix</b> is important <br>in analysis because it provides an extension <br>of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices </p></div></pre></html>
